	abstract = {How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

In contrast to this view, in our work we find that similar gain can be obtained from training with different formats of a single modality. In particular, we investigate the use of the contrastive learning framework to learn audio representations by maximizing the agreement between the raw audio and its spectral representation. We find a significant gain using this multi-format strategy against the single-format counterparts. Moreover, on the downstream AudioSet and ESC-50 classification task, our audio-only approach achieves new state-of-the-art results with a mean average precision of 0.376 and an accuracy of 90.5\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {A prominent technique for self-supervised representation learning has been to contrast semantically similar and dissimilar pairs of samples. Without access to labels, dissimilar (negative) points are typically taken to be randomly sampled datapoints, implicitly accepting that these points may, in reality, actually have the same label. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we observe that sampling negative examples from truly different labels improves performance, in a synthetic setting where labels are available. Motivated by this observation, we develop a debiased contrastive objective that corrects for the sampling of same-label datapoints, even without knowledge of the true labels. Empirically, the proposed objective consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art for representation learning in vision, language, and reinforcement learning benchmarks. Theoretically, we establish generalization bounds for the downstream classification task.},

	abstract = {While deep learning has enabled great advances in many areas of music, labeled music datasets remain especially hard, expensive, and time-consuming to create. In this work, we introduce SimCLR to the music domain and contribute a large chain of audio data augmentations to form a simple framework for self-supervised, contrastive learning of musical representations: CLMR. This approach works on raw time-domain music data and requires no labels to learn useful representations. We evaluate CLMR in the downstream task of music classification on the MagnaTagATune and Million Song datasets and present an ablation study to test which of our music-related innovations over SimCLR are most effective. A linear classifier trained on the proposed representations achieves a higher average precision than supervised models on the MagnaTagATune dataset, and performs comparably on the Million Song dataset. Moreover, we show that CLMR's representations are transferable using out-of-domain datasets, indicating that our method has strong generalisability in music classification. Lastly, we show that the proposed method allows data-efficient learning on smaller labeled datasets: we achieve an average precision of 33.1\% despite using only 259 labeled songs in the MagnaTagATune dataset (1\% of the full dataset) during linear evaluation. To foster reproducibility and future research on self-supervised learning in music, we publicly release the pre-trained models and the source code of all experiments of this paper.},

	abstract = {Anomalous sound detection for machine condition monitoring has great potential in the development of Industry 4.0. However, these anomalous sounds of machines are usually unavailable in normal conditions. Therefore, the models employed have to learn acoustic representations with normal sounds for training, and detect anomalous sounds while testing. In this article, we propose a self-supervised dual-path Transformer (SSDPT) network to detect anomalous sounds in machine monitoring. The SSDPT network splits the acoustic features into segments and employs several DPT blocks for time and frequency modeling. DPT blocks use attention modules to alternately model the interactive information about the frequency and temporal components of the segmented acoustic features. To address the problem of lack of anomalous sound, we adopt a self-supervised learning approach to train the network with normal sound. Specifically, this approach randomly masks and reconstructs the acoustic features, and jointly classifies machine identity information to improve the performance of anomalous sound detection. We evaluated our method on the DCASE2021 task2 dataset. The experimental results show that the SSDPT network achieves a significant increase in the harmonic mean AUC score, in comparison to present state-of-the-art methods of anomalous sound detection.},

	abstract = {Recently, neural networks based purely on self-attention, such as the Vision Transformer (ViT), have been shown to outperform deep learning models constructed with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on various vision tasks, thus extending the success of Transformers, which were originally developed for language processing, to the vision domain. A recent study showed that a similar methodology can also be applied to the audio domain. Specifically, the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) achieves state-of-the-art results on various audio classification benchmarks. However, pure Transformer models tend to require more training data compared to CNNs, and the success of the AST relies on supervised pretraining that requires a large amount of labeled data and a complex training pipeline, thus limiting the practical usage of AST. This paper focuses on audio and speech classification, and aims to reduce the need for large amounts of labeled data for the AST by leveraging self-supervised learning using unlabeled data. Specifically, we propose to pretrain the AST model with joint discriminative and generative masked spectrogram patch modeling (MSPM) using unlabeled audio from AudioSet and Librispeech. We evaluate our pretrained models on both audio and speech classification tasks including audio event classification, keyword spotting, emotion recognition, and speaker identification. The proposed self-supervised framework significantly boosts AST performance on all tasks, with an average improvement of 60.9\%, leading to similar or even better results than a supervised pretrained AST. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first patch-based self-supervised learning framework in the audio and speech domain, and also the first self-supervised learning framework for AST.},

	abstract = {Currently, most real-world time series datasets are multivariate and are rich in dynamical information of the underlying system. Such datasets are attracting much attention; therefore, the need for accurate modelling of such high-dimensional datasets is increasing. Recently, the deep architecture of the recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variant long short-term memory (LSTM) have been proven to be more accurate than traditional statistical methods in modelling time series data. Despite the reported advantages of the deep LSTM model, its performance in modelling multivariate time series (MTS) data has not been satisfactory, particularly when attempting to process highly non-linear and long-interval MTS datasets. The reason is that the supervised learning approach initializes the neurons randomly in such recurrent networks, disabling the neurons that ultimately must properly learn the latent features of the correlated variables included in the MTS dataset. In this paper, we propose a pre-trained LSTM-based stacked autoencoder (LSTM-SAE) approach in an unsupervised learning fashion to replace the random weight initialization strategy adopted in deep LSTM recurrent networks. For evaluation purposes, two different case studies that include real-world datasets are investigated, where the performance of the proposed approach compares favourably with the deep LSTM approach. In addition, the proposed approach outperforms several reference models investigating the same case studies. Overall, the experimental results clearly show that the unsupervised pre-training approach improves the performance of deep LSTM and leads to better and faster convergence than other models.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00148},
	abstract = {Mechanical devices such as engines, vehicles, aircrafts, etc., are typically instrumented with numerous sensors to capture the behavior and health of the machine. However, there are often external factors or variables which are not captured by sensors leading to time-series which are inherently unpredictable. For instance, manual controls and/or unmonitored environmental conditions or load may lead to inherently unpredictable time-series. Detecting anomalies in such scenarios becomes challenging using standard approaches based on mathematical models that rely on stationarity, or prediction models that utilize prediction errors to detect anomalies. We propose a Long Short Term Memory Networks based Encoder-Decoder scheme for Anomaly Detection (EncDec-AD) that learns to reconstruct 'normal' time-series behavior, and thereafter uses reconstruction error to detect anomalies. We experiment with three publicly available quasi predictable time-series datasets: power demand, space shuttle, and ECG, and two real-world engine datasets with both predictive and unpredictable behavior. We show that EncDec-AD is robust and can detect anomalies from predictable, unpredictable, periodic, aperiodic, and quasi-periodic time-series. Further, we show that EncDec-AD is able to detect anomalies from short time-series (length as small as 30) as well as long time-series (length as large as 500).},

	abstract = {Manufacturing processes are characterized by their temporal and spatial distributed nonlinear physics. Analytical models are not available and numerical models do not incorporate abnormal process effects that are not known to the engineer. These unknown anomalies cause reduced process stability and fluctuant product quality. To tackle the problem, numerous approaches for anomaly detection based on neural networks have been developed over the years. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have also been investigated intensively for prediction purposes. Current approaches lack in the capability of constructing prediction models for both process and anomaly behavior. Furthermore, they do not deliver a solution for short-term as well as long-term anomalies. Hence, the current paper presents a novel detection and prediction procedure based on a LSTM architecture to cooperatively predict process outputs and anomalies by using two separate but interacting models. The anomaly detector is realized as stacked LSTM auto-encoder and the cooperative prediction models are based on sequence-to-sequence networks with gated recurrent units for short-term and LSTM for long-term effects. The approach is evaluated within a real industrial environment by means of a production plant for hot forging at a German automotive supplier for metal components.},

Compared with existing methods, the proposed method is faster to train and more accurate. First, original sensor data are converted to images by conducting a Wavelet transformation to obtain time-frequency distributions. Next, a pretrained network is used to extract lower level features. The labeled time-frequency images are then used to fine-tune the higher levels of the neural network architecture. This paper creates a machine fault diagnosis pipeline and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness and generalization of the pipeline on three main mechanical datasets including induction motors, gearboxes, and bearings with sizes of 6000, 9000, and 5000 time series samples, respectively. We achieve state-of-the-art results on each dataset, with most datasets showing test accuracy near 100\%, and in the gearbox dataset, we achieve significant improvement from 94.8\% to 99.64\%.

	abstract = {To train deep learning algorithms, a sufficient number of data are required. However, in most engineering systems, the acquisition of fault data is difficult or sometimes not feasible, while normal data are secured. The dearth of data is one of the major challenges to developing deep learning models, and fault diagnosis in particular cannot be made in the absence of fault data. With this context, this paper proposes an anomaly detection methodology for rotating machines using only normal data with self-labeling. Since only normal data are used for anomaly detection, a self-labeling method is used to generate a new labeled dataset. The overall procedure includes the following three steps: (1) transformation of normal data to self-labeled data based on a pretext task, (2) training the convolutional neural networks (CNN), and (3) anomaly detection using defined anomaly score based on the softmax output of the trained CNN. The softmax value of the abnormal sample shows different behavior from the normal softmax values. To verify the proposed method, four case studies were conducted, on the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset, IEEE PHM 2012 data challenge dataset, PHMAP 2021 data challenge dataset, and laboratory bearing testbed; and the results were compared to those of existing machine learning and deep learning methods. The results showed that the proposed algorithm could detect faults in the bearing testbed and compressor with over 99.7\% accuracy. In particular, it was possible to detect not only bearing faults but also structural faults such as unbalance and belt looseness with very high accuracy. Compared with the existing GAN, the autoencoder-based anomaly detection algorithm, the proposed method showed high anomaly detection performance.},

Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

The dataset contains infrared (IR) images collected under both normal conditions and synthetic anomalies. We show that our encoder-decoder model is able to identify the injected anomalies in a modern AM manufacturing process in an unsupervised fashion.

Features learned from the SAE are then used to train a neural network classifier for identifying induction motor faults. In addition, to prevent overfitting during the training process, a recently developed regularization method called “dropout” which has been proved to be very effective in neural network was employed. An experiment performed on a machine fault simulator indicates that compared with traditional neural network, the SAE-based DNN can achieve superior performance for feature learning and classification in the field of induction motor fault diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Fault diagnosis plays an important role in modern industry. With the development of smart manufacturing, the data-driven fault diagnosis becomes hot. However, traditional methods have two shortcomings: 1) their performances depend on the good design of handcrafted features of data, but it is difficult to predesign these features and 2) they work well under a general assumption: the training data and testing data should be drawn from the same distribution, but this assumption fails in many engineering applications. Since deep learning (DL) can extract the hierarchical representation features of raw data, and transfer learning provides a good way to perform a learning task on the different but related distribution datasets, deep transfer learning (DTL) has been developed for fault diagnosis. In this paper, a new DTL method is proposed. It uses a three-layer sparse auto-encoder to extract the features of raw data, and applies the maximum mean discrepancy term to minimizing the discrepancy penalty between the features from training data and testing data. The proposed DTL is tested on the famous motor bearing dataset from the Case Western Reserve University. The results show a good improvement, and DTL achieves higher prediction accuracies on most experiments than DL. The prediction accuracy of DTL, which is as high as 99.82\%, is better than the results of other algorithms, including deep belief network, sparse filter, artificial neural network, support vector machine and some other traditional methods. What is more, two additional analytical experiments are conducted. The results show that a good unlabeled third dataset may be helpful to DTL, and a good linear relationship between the final prediction accuracies and their standard deviations have been observed.},

However, it is still difficult to prepare sufficient labeled data on the tested machine. Therefore, the idea of transferring fault diagnosis knowledge learned from one machine to different but related machines is motivated, and that is realized through a deep learning-based method in this paper. Features of different equipments are first projected into the same subspace using an auto-encoder structure, and cross-machine adaptation algorithm is adopted for knowledge generalization, where the distribution discrepancy between data from different machines is minimized. Experiments on three rolling bearing datasets are implemented to validate the proposed method. The results suggest it is feasible to transfer fault diagnosis knowledge across different machines, and the proposed method offers a novel and promising approach for knowledge generalization.},

In this work, we present a novel representation learning method, namely class level autoencoder (CLAE) for fault diagnosis which aims to learn representative and discriminative features from vibration signals. Specifically, we formulate a novel loss function for representation learning by jointly minimizing the basic and class level reconstruction errors to restrain intra-class variations in the feature space. In addition, we propose a new and simple feature pooling strategy to effectively fuse various meaningful local features to capture efficient and inherent fault pattern information about the input. Extensive experimental results on rolling bearing dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves very competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, it still suffers many challenges such as various working conditions, large environmental noise interference and insufficient effective data samples. Signal time–frequency analysis and feature transfer learning methods can help solve these problems. Combining wavelet packet transform (WPT) and multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD), this paper proposes a novel residual network (ResNet)-based deep transfer diagnosis model for bearing faults. Firstly, this paper devises a distinctive WPT time–frequency feature map (WPT-TFFM) construction method using WPT for time–frequency analysis on nonlinear and non-stationary vibration signals. Then, a modified multi-group parallel ResNet network is structured to extract the depth features of WPT-TFFM for the characteristics of small size and feature dispersion. Then, MK-MMD is further applied to evaluate the distribution difference between the depth features of the source and target domain data. Combining with the classification loss of the sample set with the source domain, the depth features extraction network is optimized to achieve better cross-domain invariance and fault state differentiation capability of the depth features. To evaluate the proposed method, this work conducts comparative experiments on two test rigs under different working loads and speeds. The results reveal that the proposed method offers excellent fault diagnosis and noise prevention capability for working condition transfer tasks.},

In this way, the dependence on a large number of target-domain data can be reduced for constructing target learners. Due to the wide application prospects, transfer learning has become a popular and promising area in machine learning. Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning research studies, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey article reviews more than 40 representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over 20 representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different data sets, that is, Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31, and the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.},

As a result, DTL techniques can make DL-based fault diagnosis methods more reliable, robust and applicable, and they have been widely developed and investigated in the field of Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD). Although several systematic and valuable review articles have been published on the topic of IFD, they summarized relevant research only from an algorithm perspective and overlooked practical applications in industry scenarios. Furthermore, a comprehensive review on DTL-based IFD methods is still lacking. From this insight, it is particularly important and more necessary to comprehensively survey the relevant publications of DTL-based IFD, which will help readers to conveniently understand the current state-of-the-art techniques and to quickly design an effective solution for solving IFD problems in practice. First, theoretical backgrounds of DTL are briefly introduced to present how the transfer learning techniques can be integrated with deep learning models. Then, major applications of DTL and their recent developments in the field of IFD are detailed and discussed. More importantly, suggestions on how to select DTL algorithms in practical applications, and some future challenges are shared. Finally, conclusions of this survey are given. At last, we have reason to believe that the works done in this article can provide convenience and inspiration for the researchers who want to devote their efforts in the progress and advance of IFD.},

	abstract = {The success of intelligent fault diagnosis of machines relies on the following two conditions: 1) labeled data with fault information are available; and 2) the training and testing data are drawn from the same probability distribution. However, for some machines, it is difficult to obtain massive labeled data. Moreover, even though labeled data can be obtained from some machines, the intelligent fault diagnosis method trained with such labeled data possibly fails in classifying unlabeled data acquired from the other machines due to data distribution discrepancy. These problems limit the successful applications of intelligent fault diagnosis of machines with unlabeled data. As a potential tool, transfer learning adapts a model trained in a source domain to its application in a target domain. Based on the transfer learning, we propose a new intelligent method named deep convolutional transfer learning network (DCTLN). A DCTLN consists of two modules: condition recognition and domain adaptation. The condition recognition module is constructed by a one-dimensional (1-D) convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically learn features and recognize health conditions of machines. The domain adaptation module facilitates the 1-D CNN to learn domain-invariant features by maximizing domain recognition errors and minimizing the probability distribution distance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using six transfer fault diagnosis experiments.},

With the development of smart manufacturing, the data-driven fault diagnosis becomes a hot topic. However, the traditional data-driven fault diagnosis methods rely on the features extracted by experts. The feature extraction process is an exhausted work and greatly impacts the final result. Deep learning (DL) provides an effective way to extract the features of raw data automatically. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is an effective DL method. In this study, a new CNN based on LeNet-5 is proposed for fault diagnosis. Through a conversion method converting signals into two-dimensional (2-D) images, the proposed method can extract the features of the converted 2-D images and eliminate the effect of handcrafted features. The proposed method which is tested on three famous datasets, including motor bearing dataset, self-priming centrifugal pump dataset, and axial piston hydraulic pump dataset, has achieved prediction accuracy of 99.79\%, 99.481\%, and 100\%, respectively. The results have been compared with other DL and traditional methods, including adaptive deep CNN, sparse filter, deep belief network, and support vector machine. The comparisons show that the proposed CNN-based data-driven fault diagnosis method has achieved significant improvements.},

	abstract = {We describe a novel unsupervised method for learning sparse, overcomplete features. The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces "stroke detectors" when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like filters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the first layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical filter maps.},

	title = {How transferable are features in deep neural networks?},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1792},
	abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.},

In this paper, we first provide a brief review of conventional ML methods, before taking a deep dive into the state-of-the-art DL algorithms for bearing fault applications. Specifically, the superiority of DL based methods over conventional ML methods are analyzed in terms of fault feature extraction and classification performances; many new functionalities enabled by DL techniques are also summarized. In addition, to obtain a more intuitive insight, a comparative study is conducted on the classification accuracy of different algorithms utilizing the open-source Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset. Finally, to facilitate the transition on applying various DL algorithms to bearing fault diagnostics, detailed recommendations and suggestions are provided for specific application conditions such as the setup environment, the data size, and the number of sensors and sensor types. Future research directions to further enhance the performance of DL algorithms on health monitoring are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Condition-based monitoring and machine fault detection play important roles in industry as they can ensure safety and reduce breakdown loss. Weak signal detection is an essential stage in many signal processing-based machine fault detection methods because the acquired machine signals are always corrupted by heavy background noise. Stochastic resonance (SR) is a nonlinear phenomenon in which the weak signal can be enhanced with the assistance of proper noise. Due to this distinct merit, SR has been extensively investigated in rotating machine fault detection. Given this, the present study is committed to providing a comprehensive review of SR from history to state-of-the-art methods and finally to research prospects, along with the applications in rotating machine fault detection. First, the classical SR theory including the history, merits and limitations is introduced and discussed, and the basic research progress of SR is reviewed. Second, the modified SR methods designed for processing the rotating machine signals are reviewed and summarized. Third, applications of SR for analyzing different kinds of rotating machine fault signals are introduced. Finally, the open problems, challenges and research prospects of SR in rotating machine fault detection are discussed.},

This paper addresses a sequential algorithm for the MSTSR method to detect the train bearing faults in an embedded system through the acoustic signal analysis. Specifically, the energy operator, digital filter array, and fourth rank Runge-Kutta equation methods are designed to realize the signal demodulation, multiscale noise tuning, and bistable stochastic resonance in sequence. The merit of the sequential algorithm is that it reduces the memory consumption and decreases the computation complexity, so that it can be efficiently implemented in the embedded system based on a low-cost, low-power hardware platform. After the sequential algorithm, the real-valued fast Fourier transform is used to calculate the power spectrum of the analyzed signal. The proposed method has been verified in algorithm performance and hardware implementation by three kinds of practical acoustic signals from defective train bearings. An enhanced performance of the proposed fault diagnosis method is confirmed as compared with several traditional methods, and the hardware performance is also validated.},

Moreover, because the existing PdM research is still in primary experimental stage, most works are conducted utilizing several open-datasets, and the combination with specific applications such as rotating machinery is especially rare. Hence, in this paper, we focus on data-driven methods for PdM, present a comprehensive survey on its applications, and attempt to provide graduate students, companies, and institutions with the preliminary understanding of the existing works recently published. Specifically, we first briefly introduce the PdM approach, illustrate our PdM scheme for automatic washing equipment, and demonstrate the challenges encountered when we conduct a PdM research. Second, we classify the specific industrial applications based on six algorithms of machine learning and deep learning (DL), and compare five performance metrics for each classification. Furthermore, the accuracy (a metric to evaluate the algorithm performance) of these PdM applications is analyzed in detail. There are some important conclusions: 1) the data used in the summarized literature are mostly from public datasets, such as case western reserve university (CWRU)/intelligent maintenance systems (IMS); and 2) in recent years, researchers seem to focus more on DL algorithms for PdM research. Finally, we summarize the common features regarding our surveyed PdM applications and discuss several potential directions.},

Since the existing surveys on wind turbine condition monitoring cover the literatures up to 2006, this review aims to report the most recent advances in the past three years, with primary focus on gearbox and bearing, rotor and blades, generator and power electronics, as well as system-wise turbine diagnosis. There are several major trends observed through the survey. Due to the variable-speed nature of wind turbine operation and the unsteady load involved, time-frequency analysis tools such as wavelets have been accepted as a key signal processing tool for such application. Acoustic emission has lately gained much more attention in order to detect incipient failures because of the low-speed operation for wind turbines. There has been an increasing trend of developing model based reasoning algorithms for fault detection and isolation as cost-effective approach for wind turbines as relatively complicated system. The impact of unsteady aerodynamic load on the robustness of diagnostic signatures has been notified. Decoupling the wind load from condition monitoring decision making will reduce the associated down-time cost.},

This paper aims to review and summarize these publications and provide comprehensive references for researchers interested in this topic. The structures of a planetary gearbox as well as a fixed-axis one are briefly introduced and contrasted. The unique behaviors and fault characteristics of planetary gearboxes are identified and analyzed.

The manufacturers and users of these drives are now keen to include diagnostic features in the software to improve salability and reliability. Apart from locating specific harmonic components in the line current (popularly known as motor current signature analysis), other signals, such as speed, torque, noise, vibration etc., are also explored for their frequency contents. Sometimes, altogether different techniques, such as thermal measurements, chemical analysis, etc., are also employed to find out the nature and the degree of the fault. In addition, human involvement in the actual fault detection decision making is slowly being replaced by automated tools, such as expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy-logic-based systems; to name a few. It is indeed evident that this area is vast in scope. Hence, keeping in mind the need for future research, a review paper describing different types of faults and the signatures they generate and their diagnostics' schemes will not be entirely out of place.

This paper focuses on dynamics based gearbox fault modeling, detection and diagnosis. State-of-art and challenges are reviewed and discussed.

	abstract = {Aiming to promptly process the massive fault data and automatically provide accurate diagnosis results, numerous studies have been conducted on intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Among these studies, the methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly used, which employ signal processing techniques for extracting features and further input the features to ANNs for classifying faults. Though these methods did work in intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, they still have two deficiencies. (1) The features are manually extracted depending on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise. In addition, these manual features are extracted according to a specific diagnosis issue and probably unsuitable for other issues. (2) The ANNs adopted in these methods have shallow architectures, which limits the capacity of ANNs to learn the complex non-linear relationships in fault diagnosis issues. As a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, deep learning holds the potential to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies. Through deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) with deep architectures, instead of shallow ones, could be established to mine the useful information from raw data and approximate complex non-linear functions. Based on DNNs, a novel intelligent method is proposed in this paper to overcome the deficiencies of the aforementioned intelligent diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using datasets from rolling element bearings and planetary gearboxes. These datasets contain massive measured signals involving different health conditions under various operating conditions. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively mine available fault characteristics from the measured signals, but also obtain superior diagnosis accuracy compared with the existing methods.},

This is a promising way to release the contribution from human labor and automatically recognize the health states of machines, thus it has attracted much attention in the last two or three decades. Although IFD has achieved a considerable number of successes, a review still leaves a blank space to systematically cover the development of IFD from the cradle to the bloom, and rarely provides potential guidelines for the future development. To bridge the gap, this article presents a review and roadmap to systematically cover the development of IFD following the progress of machine learning theories and offer a future perspective. In the past, traditional machine learning theories began to weak the contribution of human labor and brought the era of artificial intelligence to machine fault diagnosis. Over the recent years, the advent of deep learning theories has reformed IFD in further releasing the artificial assistance since the 2010s, which encourages to construct an end-to-end diagnosis procedure. It means to directly bridge the relationship between the increasingly-grown monitoring data and the health states of machines. In the future, transfer learning theories attempt to use the diagnosis knowledge from one or multiple diagnosis tasks to other related ones, which prospectively overcomes the obstacles in applications of IFD to engineering scenarios. Finally, the roadmap of IFD is pictured to show potential research trends when combined with the challenges in this field.},

	abstract = {The research on intelligent fault diagnosis has yielded remarkable achievements based on artificial intelligence-related technologies. In engineering scenarios, machines usually work in a normal condition, which means limited fault data can be collected. Intelligent fault diagnosis with small \& imbalanced data (S\&I-IFD), which refers to build intelligent diagnosis models using limited machine faulty samples to achieve accurate fault identification, has been attracting the attention of researchers. Nowadays, the research on S\&I-IFD has achieved fruitful results, but a review of the latest achievements is still lacking, and the future research directions are not clear enough. To address this, we review the research results on S\&I-IFD and provides some future perspectives in this paper. The existing research results are divided into three categories: the data augmentation-based, the feature learning-based, and the classifier design-based. Data augmentation-based strategy improves the performance of diagnosis models by augmenting training data. Feature learning-based strategy identifies faults accurately by extracting features from small \& imbalanced data. Classifier design-based strategy achieves high diagnosis accuracy by constructing classifiers suitable for small \& imbalanced data. Finally, this paper points out the research challenges faced by S\&I-IFD and provides some directions that may bring breakthroughs, including meta-learning and zero-shot learning.},

	abstract = {Bearings are the most common mechanical components in machines. Once a bearing fails (or components in it), other adjacent components or the machine itself are effected up to failure. Therefore, bearing health condition is of great interest in practice. Several benchmark datasets are developed to evaluate development in bearings health state (diagnosis) and remaining useful lifetime (prognosis). Among these datasets, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset is one of the most cited ones used to validate the performance of different diagnostic approaches. Over recent years, a significant amount of research approaches are developed using CWRU data. Most approaches are focused on specific performance parameters like detection rate or accuracy etc. The main problems in connection with CWRU dataset use are: no overview about latest results is available. Furthermore several results published are not complete, for example published accuracies rate without false alarm rates.In this contribution an overview about the development change over the last years, the approaches applied, and specifically the results obtained will be given. Additionally, the new approaches emerging in recent years like deep learning (DL) also in combination with fusion methods and related performance will be given in comparison with conventional machine learning (ML) methods. Special care will be given to the completeness of published results also in combination with shown robustness. As outcome of this contribution the newest and best results are noted, furthermore a recommendation how to complete research work using benchmark dataset will be given. Although most approaches using CWRU dataset as benchmark get high accuracy, for further bearing fault diagnosis research, more and more suitable measures as well as other datasets are needed for increased performance evaluation.},

While conventional machine learning (ML) methods, including artificial neural network, principal component analysis, support vector machines, etc., have been successfully applied to the detection and categorization of bearing faults for decades, recent developments in DL algorithms in the last five years have sparked renewed interest in both industry and academia for intelligent machine health monitoring. In this paper, we first provide a brief review of conventional ML methods, before taking a deep dive into the state-of-the-art DL algorithms for bearing fault applications. Specifically, the superiority of DL based methods are analyzed in terms of fault feature extraction and classification performances; many new functionalities enabled by DL techniques are also summarized. In addition, to obtain a more intuitive insight, a comparative study is conducted on the classification accuracy of different algorithms utilizing the open source Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset. Finally, to facilitate the transition on applying various DL algorithms to bearing fault diagnostics, detailed recommendations and suggestions are provided for specific application conditions. Future research directions to further enhance the performance of DL algorithms on health monitoring are also discussed.},

Additionally, artificial intelligence is the core technology of smart factories. The use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms has produced fruitful results in many fields like image processing, speech recognition, fault detection, object detection, or medical sciences. With the increment in the use of smart machinery, the faults in the machinery equipment are expected to increase. Machinery fault detection and diagnosis through various deep learning algorithms has increased day by day. Many types of research have been done and published using both open-source and closed-source datasets, implementing the deep learning algorithms. Out of many publicly available datasets, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset has been widely used to detect and diagnose machinery bearing fault and is accepted as a standard reference for validating the models. This paper summarizes the recent works which use the CWRU bearing dataset in machinery fault detection and diagnosis employing deep learning algorithms. We have reviewed the published works and presented the working algorithm, result, and other necessary details in this paper.

	abstract = {With the rapid development of manufacturing industry, machine fault diagnosis has become increasingly significant to ensure safe equipment operation and production. Consequently, multifarious approaches have been explored and developed in the past years, of which intelligent algorithms develop particularly rapidly. Convolutional neural network (CNN), as a typical representative of intelligent diagnostic models, has been extensively studied and applied in recent five years, and a large amount of literature has been published in academic journals and conference proceedings. However, there has not been a systematic review to cover these studies and make a prospect for the further research. To fill in this gap, this work attempts to review and summarize the development of the Convolutional Network based Fault Diagnosis (CNFD) approaches comprehensively. Generally, a typical CNFD framework is composed of the following steps, namely, data collection, model construction, and feature learning and decision making, thus this paper is organized by following this stream. Firstly, data collection process is described, in which several popular datasets are introduced. Then, the fundamental theory from the basic CNN to its variants is elaborated. After that, the applications of CNFD are reviewed in terms of three mainstream directions, i.e. classification, prediction and transfer diagnosis. Finally, conclusions and prospects are presented to point out the characteristics of current development, facing challenges and future trends. Last but not least, it is expected that this work would provide convenience and inspire further exploration for researchers in this field.},

However, the prerequisite that the training data and the test data should follow an identical distribution prevents the conventional data-driven diagnosis methods from being applied to the engineering diagnosis problems. To tackle this dilemma, cross-domain fault diagnosis using knowledge transfer strategy is becoming popular in the past five years. The diagnosis methods based on transfer learning aim to build models that can perform well on target tasks by leveraging knowledge from semantic related but distribution different source domains. This paper for the first time summarizes the state-of-art cross-domain fault diagnosis research works. The literatures are introduced from three different viewpoints: research motivations, cross-domain strategies, and application objects. In addition, the corresponding open-source fault datasets and several future directions are also presented. The survey provides readers a framework for better understanding and identifying the research status, challenges and future directions of cross-domain fault diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Health condition monitoring of rotating machinery is a crucial task to guarantee reliability in industrial processes. In particular, bearings are mechanical components used in most rotating devices and they represent the main source of faults in such equipments; reason for which research activities on detecting and diagnosing their faults have increased. Fault detection aims at identifying whether the device is or not in a fault condition, and diagnosis is commonly oriented towards identifying the fault mode of the device, after detection. An important step after fault detection and diagnosis is the analysis of the magnitude or the degradation level of the fault, because this represents a support to the decision-making process in condition based-maintenance. However, no extensive works are devoted to analyse this problem, or some works tackle it from the fault diagnosis point of view. In a rough manner, fault severity is associated with the magnitude of the fault. In bearings, fault severity can be related to the physical size of fault or a general degradation of the component. Due to literature regarding the severity assessment of bearing damages is limited, this paper aims at discussing the recent methods and techniques used to achieve the fault severity evaluation in the main components of the rolling bearings, such as inner race, outer race, and ball. The review is mainly focused on data-driven approaches such as signal processing for extracting the proper fault signatures associated with the damage degradation, and learning approaches that are used to identify degradation patterns with regards to health conditions. Finally, new challenges are highlighted in order to develop new contributions in this ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Mechanical fault diagnosis is important to reduce unscheduled machine downtime and avoid catastrophic accidents. It is significant to extract incipient fault and compound fault features as early as possible, which is a complex and challenging task that requests advanced analytical methods with high reliability, high accuracy and high efficiency. Compound fault features are mutually coupled in dynamic signals from the complex system. Weak features of incipient faults are always submersed in background noises. Multiwavelet transform is a remarkable development of wavelet transform, which uses vector scaling functions and wavelet functions. Multiwavelets possess the property of orthogonality, symmetry, compact support and high vanishing moments simultaneously. These advantages promote the development of multiwavelets and their applications in mechanical fault diagnosis in the past decades. This paper attempts to summarize the recent development of multiwavelet transform and its applications in mechanical fault diagnosis. First, the history of wavelets and multiwavelets is introduced. Second, the necessity and the overview of preprocessing methods for multiwavelets are summarized. Third, the advantages of multiwavelets and improvements of different generation multiwavelets are addressed. Fourth, different algorithms of these multiwavelet transforms and their flow charts are presented. Fifth, engineering applications of multiwavelets in mechanical fault diagnosis are investigated. This review also describes a simulation experiment and three application examples which provide a better understanding of different generation multiwavelets for compound fault detection. Finally, existent problems and prospects of further researches are discussed. It is expected that this review will construct an image of the contributions of different generation multiwavelets and link the current frontiers with engineering applications for readers interested in this field.},

	abstract = {Much research has been conducted in prognostics and health management (PHM), an emerging field in mechanical engineering that is gaining interest from both academia and industry. Most of these efforts have been in the area of machinery PHM, resulting in the development of many algorithms for this particular application. The majority of these algorithms concentrate on applications involving common rotary machinery components, such as bearings and gears. Knowledge of this prior work is a necessity for any future research efforts to be conducted; however, there has not been a comprehensive overview that details previous and on-going efforts in PHM. In addition, a systematic method for developing and deploying a PHM system has yet to be established. Such a method would enable rapid customization and integration of PHM systems for diverse applications. To address these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the PHM field, followed by an introduction of a systematic PHM design methodology, 5S methodology, for converting data to prognostics information. This methodology includes procedures for identifying critical components, as well as tools for selecting the most appropriate algorithms for specific applications. Visualization tools are presented for displaying prognostics information in an appropriate fashion for quick and accurate decision making. Industrial case studies are included in this paper to show how this methodology can help in the design of an effective PHM system.},

This paper reviews technical literature concerning variations in vibration properties of civil structures under changing temperature conditions. Most of these studies focus on variations in frequencies of bridge structures, with some studies on variations in mode shapes and damping and other types of structures. Statistical approaches to correlation between temperature and frequencies are also reviewed. A quantitative analysis shows that variations in material modulus under different temperatures are the major cause of the variations in vibration properties. A comparative study on different structures made of different materials is carried out in laboratory. Two real structures, the 1,377-m main span Tsing Ma Suspension Bridge and the 600-m-tall Guangzhou New Television Tower, are examined. Both laboratory experiments and field testing, regardless of different construction materials used and structural types, verify the quantitative analysis. Variations in frequencies of reinforced concrete structures are much more significant than those of steel structures.},

However, faced with the complexity and diversity of practical engineering, extracting the transient signal is a highly challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel time-frequency analysis method termed the transient-extracting transform, which can effectively characterize and extract the transient components in the fault signals. This method is based on the short-time Fourier transform and does not require extended parameters or a priori information. Quantized indicators, such as Rényi entropy and kurtosis, are employed to compare the performance of the proposed method with other classical and advanced methods. The comparisons show that the proposed method can provide a much more energy-concentrated time-frequency representation, and the transient components can be extracted with a significantly larger kurtosis. The numerical and experimental signals are used to show the effectiveness of our method.},

	abstract = {In recent years, among most approaches for few-shot learning, there exists a default premise that a big homogeneous-annotated dataset is applied to pre-train the few-shot learning model. However, since few-shot learning approaches are always used in the domain where annotated samples are rare, it would be difficult to collect another big annotated dataset in the same domain. Therefore, we propose Splicing Learning to complete the few-shot learning task without the help of a big homogeneous-annotated dataset. Splicing Learning can increase the sample size of the few-shot set by splicing multiple original images to a spliced-image. Unlike data augmentation technologies, there is no false information on the spliced-image. Through experiments, we find that the configuration “All-splice + WSG” can achieve the best test accuracy of 90.81\%, 9.19\% better than the baseline. The performance improvement of the model can be attributed to Splicing Learning mostly and has little to do with the complexity of the CNN framework. Compared with metric learning, meta-learning, and GAN models, both of Splicing Learning and data augmentation have achieved more outstanding performance. At the same time, the combination of Splicing Learning and data augmentation can further improve the test accuracy of the model to 96.33\%.

A major challenge in fault diagnosis is the infeasibility of obtaining sufficient training samples for every fault type under all working conditions. Recently deep learning based fault diagnosis methods have achieved promising results. However, most of these methods require large amount of training data. In this study, we propose a deep neural network based few-shot learning approach for rolling bearing fault diagnosis with limited data. Our model is based on the siamese neural network, which learns by exploiting sample pairs of the same or different categories. Experimental results over the standard Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing fault diagnosis benchmark dataset showed that our few-shot learning approach is more effective in fault diagnosis with limited data availability. When tested over different noise environments with minimal amount of training data, the performance of our few-shot learning model surpasses the one of the baseline with reasonable noise level. When evaluated over test sets with new fault types or new working conditions, few-shot models work better than the baseline trained with all fault types.

In real-world diagnosis, it is difficult to obtain abundant labeled data due to varying operation conditions, complex working environment and inevitable indirect measurement, which will affect the ability of diagnosing. To tackle this problem, a deep transfer maximum classifier discrepancy method is proposed under few labeled data, which utilizes fully deep learning and transfer learning. Firstly, a batch-normalized long-short term memory (BNLSTM) model which can learn the mapping relationship between two kinds of datasets is designed to generate some auxiliary samples. Then, a transfer maximum classifier discrepancy (TMCD) method, which considers the characteristics of each data type by an adversarial strategy, is applied to align probability distributions of auxiliary samples generated by BNLSTM and unlabeled data from target domain. Sufficient experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method under few labeled data.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of smart manufacturing, data-driven fault diagnosis has attracted increasing attentions. As one of the most popular methods applied in fault diagnosis, deep learning (DL) has achieved remarkable results. However, due to the fact that the volume of labeled samples is small in fault diagnosis, the depths of DL models for fault diagnosis are shallow compared with convolutional neural network in other areas (including ImageNet), which limits their final prediction accuracies. In this research, a new TCNN(ResNet-50) with the depth of 51 convolutional layers is proposed for fault diagnosis. By combining with transfer learning, TCNN(ResNet-50) applies ResNet-50 trained on ImageNet as feature extractor for fault diagnosis. Firstly, a signal-to-image method is developed to convert time-domain fault signals to RGB images format as the input datatype of ResNet-50. Then, a new structure of TCNN(ResNet-50) is proposed. Finally, the proposed TCNN(ResNet-50) has been tested on three datasets, including bearing damage dataset provided by KAT datacenter, motor bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and self-priming centrifugal pump dataset. It achieved state-of-the-art results. The prediction accuracies of TCNN(ResNet-50) are as high as 98.95\% ± 0.0074, 99.99\% ± 0 and 99.20\% ± 0, which demonstrates that TCNN(ResNet-50) outperforms other DL models and traditional methods.},

	abstract = {Intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings has made some achievements based on the availability of massive labeled data. However, the available data from bearings used in real-case machines (BRMs) are insufficient to train a reliable intelligent diagnosis model. Fortunately, we can easily simulate various faults of bearings in a laboratory, and the data from bearings used in laboratory machines (BLMs) contain diagnosis knowledge related to the data from BRMs. Therefore, inspired by the idea of transfer learning, we propose a feature-based transfer neural network (FTNN) to identify the health states of BRMs with the help of the diagnosis knowledge from BLMs. In the proposed method, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed to extract transferable features of raw vibration data from BLMs and BRMs. Then, the regularization terms of multi-layer domain adaptation and pseudo label learning are developed to impose constraints on the parameters of CNN so as to reduce the distribution discrepancy and the among-class distance of the learned transferable features. The proposed method is verified by two fault diagnosis cases of bearings, in which the health states of locomotive bearings in real cases are identified by using the data respectively collected from motor bearings and gearbox bearings in laboratories. The results show that the proposed method is able to effectively learn transferable features to bridge the discrepancy between the data from BLMs and BRMs. Consequently, it presents higher diagnosis accuracy for BRMs than existing methods.},

	abstract = {Wind park operators start to recognize the cost-effectiveness of intelligent maintenance solutions for wind turbines based on the readily available 10-minute SCADA data. In particular, recent advances have shown that deep learning algorithms can enhance the performance and robustness of fault detection algorithms which are fed with such SCADA data. In order to deploy deep learning fault detection algorithms, a large amount of historical data is needed. In case the data is not available for a certain turbine, training the algorithms becomes challenging. The common approaches in this case are referred to as transfer learning or domain adaptation methods, which attempt to allow the transfer of knowledge between different machines.
In this paper we explore the main challenges of domain adaptation for fault detection based on wind turbine SCADA data. We focus on practical use cases, stemming from the commercial need to deploy fault detection algorithms for newly installed turbines, or turbines with little historical data under diverse operating conditions. We analyze different reasons for domain shifts between turbines, which require the development of new domain adaptation approaches beyond the ones familiar for other PHM applications, and present results for several of these challenging cases.},

As did for our previous ToyADMOS dataset, we collected a large number of operating sounds of miniature machines (toys) under normal and anomaly conditions by deliberately damaging them but extended with providing controlled depth of damages in anomaly samples. Since typical application scenarios of ADMOS often require robust performance under domain-shift conditions, the ToyADMOS2 dataset is designed for evaluating systems under such conditions. The released dataset consists of two sub-datasets for machine-condition inspection: fault diagnosis of machines with geometrically fixed tasks and fault diagnosis of machines with moving tasks. Domain shifts are represented by introducing several differences in operating conditions, such as the use of the same machine type but with different machine models and parts configurations, different operating speeds, microphone arrangements, etc. Each sub-dataset contains over 27 k samples of normal machine-operating sounds and over 8 k samples of anomalous sounds recorded with five to eight microphones. The dataset is freely available for download at https://github.com/nttcslab/ToyADMOS2-dataset and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4580270.},

	abstract = {The past years have witnessed the successful development of intelligent machinery fault diagnostic methods. Besides the basic data-driven fault diagnosis tasks where the training and testing data are collected from the same distribution, the more practical cross-domain problems have also attracted much attention considering variations of machine operating conditions. In the literature, most existing studies generally assume the availability of testing data during model training, thus facilitating explicit domain adaptations. However, this assumption poses obstacles in the application on real-time cross-domain fault diagnosis, where the testing data can not be obtained in advance. This paper proposes a deep learning-based domain generalization method for machinery fault diagnosis. A domain augmentation method is adopted to expand the available dataset. Domain adversarial training is implemented, and generalized features can be learned from different domains, which hold in new working scenarios without assuming the availability of testing data. Distance metric learning is also used to further enhance model robustness in fault classifications. Through experiments on two rotating machinery datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated, which is promising in on-line cross-domain fault diagnosis tasks.},

In order to address the domain shift problem, minimizing the marginal domain distribution discrepancy is considered in most of the existing studies. While improvements have been achieved, the class-level alignments between domains are generally neglected, resulting in deteriorations in testing performance. This paper proposes an adversarial multi-classifier optimization method for cross-domain fault diagnosis based on deep learning. Through adversarial training, the overfitting phenomena of different classifiers are exploited to achieve class-level domain adaptation effects, facilitating extraction of domain-invariant features and development of cross-domain classifiers. Experiments on three rotating machinery datasets are carried out for validations, and the results suggest the proposed method is promising for cross-domain fault diagnostic tasks.},

First, the multiple convolutional layers were used to extract transferable features layer-by-layer from the raw vibration data of source and the target domain. Then, multi-layer balanced domain adaptation is applied to help training the model, which can reduce the discrepancy of the marginal probability distribution and the conditional probability distribution simultaneously. At last, the test data was fed into the model to evaluate the performance.

	abstract = {The planetary gearbox plays an important role in many advanced electromechanical mechanisms. The mechanical fault is a major factor that threatens the service performance of a planetary gearbox. Deep learning (DL) algorithms have been widely used to identify faults and health status of industrial equipment. However, owing to diversified equipment structures, variable working conditions and disparate data acquisition, the service performance of DL-based methods may degrade significantly when applied to different industrial sites. Domain adaptation emerges as a promising idea that aims to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a different but related target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep domain-adaptive multi-task learning model Y-Net, which is exploited to enable domain-adaptive diagnosis of faults in planetary gearboxes. The SE-Res modules are utilized to reduce the redundancy of the model and improving the separability of deep features. Furthermore, a soft joint maximum mean discrepancy (SJMMD) is introduced to link the two pipeline in order to reduce both the marginal and conditional distribution discrepancy of the learned features, with the enhancement of auxiliary soft labels. The domain adaption between different planetary gearbox under variant operating condition is realized by the Y-Net. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SJMMD over conventional maximum mean discrepancy, especially when the datasets of different domains suffer different imbalances.},

	abstract = {Rotating machines are broadly used in the manufacturing industry and they usually need to remain operational for an extended period and in harsh environments, which causes degradation and can eventually lead to failures in components.
Bearings are one the most critical components in rotating machines. Bearing failures result in unplanned downtime and thus impacting the production and maintenance costs. To reduce the costs, monitoring the condition of bearings plays, therefore, a vital role in the maintenance program of the industry. It could allow to move from a time-based preventive maintenance program to a condition-based maintenance (CBM) or\&nbsp; predictive maintenance (PdM) strategy. An essential aspect in bearing fault detection are methodologies that compute and/or calculate condition indicators (features) from noisy vibration signals acquired during early fault stages. These strategies ought to be: (1) data-efficient: one is faced, in many industrial settings, with a lack of training data, a lack of ground truth and scarce information on machine design and operational conditions, (2) power-efficient: it is important that the edge device that is monitoring the health of the machine is power-efficient, as edge devices are often battery-powered, and (3) insensitive to industrial disturbances such as signals originating from other mechanical or electrical components or sensor noise. These are challenges often faced by companies. Providing technological solutions to these issues reduces unexpected downtime and additional costs, including avoiding unnecessary and costly replacement of healthy machine components.
In light of the aforementioned technological challenges, we present the wavelet scattering network application to bearing fault detection, this technique is based on wavelet transform, where it computes translation-invariant features that are locally stable to deformation, making it particularly useful in classification and clustering purposes. The method is experimentally validated with data acquired using the Smart Maintenance Living Lab of Flanders Make. It consists of seven identical drive train sub-systems representing a fleet of machines, on which accelerated life time tests of bearings have been performed. Seventy runs overall have been gathered, twenty-one of which are healthy bearing runs, and the other forty-nine are runs to failure with a small initial indent on the bearing inner race.
Furthermore, the wavelet scattering network feature extraction method is benchmarked to : (1) manually-engineered statistical features such as root mean square, kurtosis, crest factor and peak value, (2) a physics-based bearing fault detection method that is a version of the squared envelope spectrum method of vibration signals extended with several noise reductions and signal enhancement techniques, (3) a convolutional neural network based detection method that autonomously learns useful features and does not require a significant level of knowledge of signal processing techniques and domain expertise..
This benchmark is done on three industrially relevant performance metrics namely : Penalized accuracy, Data efficiency and Power efficiency.},

A significant task in deep residual network-based fault diagnosis is to prevent overfitting, which is often a major reason for low diagnostic accuracy when there is insufficient training data. This paper develops a multiple wavelet regularized deep residual network (MWR-DRN) model that uses one wavelet basis function (WBF) as the primary WBF and other WBFs as the auxiliary WBFs. “Regularized” means that a constraint or restriction is applied to yield a high performance on the testing data. To be specific, the developed MWR-DRN model is trained not only by the 2D matrices from the primary WBF, but also by the 2D matrices from the auxiliary WBFs using a stochastic selection strategy. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the developed MWR-DRN in improving diagnostic accuracy.},

	abstract = {The implementation of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis system (CMFDS) on wind turbine is significant to lower the unscheduled breakdown. Generator is one of the most important components in wind turbine, and generator bearing fault identification always draws lots of attention. However, non-stationary vibration signal of weak fault and compound fault with a large amount of background noise makes this task challenging in many cases. So, effective signal processing method is essential in the accurate diagnosis step of CMFDS. As a novel signal processing method, empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) is used to extract inherent modulation information by decomposing signal into mono-components under an orthogonal basis, which is seen as a powerful tool for mechanical fault diagnosis. Moreover, in order to avoid the inaccurate identification the internal modes caused by the heavy noise, wavelet spatial neighboring coefficient denoising with data-driven threshold is applied to increase Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) before EWT. The effectiveness of the proposed technique on weak fault and compound fault diagnosis is first validated by two experimental cases. Finally, the proposed method has been applied to identify fault feature of generator bearing on wind turbine in wind farm successfully.},

	abstract = {After analyzing the shortcomings of current feature extraction and fault diagnosis technologies, a new approach based on wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) are combined to extract fault feature frequency and neural network for rotating machinery early fault diagnosis is proposed. Acquisition signals with fault frequency feature are decomposed into a series of narrow bandwidth using WPD method for de-noising, then, the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which usually denoted the features of corresponding frequency bandwidth can be obtained by applying EMD method. Thus, the component of IMF with signal feature can be separated from all IMFs and the energy moment of IMFs is proposed as eigenvector to effectively express the failure feature. The classical three layers BP neural network model taking the fault feature frequency as target input of neural network, the 5 spectral bandwidth energy of vibration signal spectrum as characteristic parameter, and the 10 types of representative rotor fault as output can be established to identify the fault pattern of a machine. Lastly, the fault identification model of rotating machinery with rotor lateral early crack based on BP neural network is taken as an example. The results show that the proposed method can effectively get the signal feature to diagnose the occurrence of early fault of rotating machinery.},

	abstract = {This paper extends wavelet methodology to handle comovement dynamics of multivariate time series via moving weighted regression on wavelet coefficients. The concept of wavelet local multiple correlation is used to produce one single set of multiscale correlations along time, in contrast with the large number of wavelet correlation maps that need to be compared when using standard pairwise wavelet correlations with rolling windows. Also, the spectral properties of weight functions are investigated and it is argued that some common time windows, such as the usual rectangular rolling window, are not satisfactory on these grounds. The method is illustrated with a multiscale analysis of the comovements of Eurozone stock markets during this century. It is shown how the evolution of the correlation structure in these markets has been far from homogeneous both along time and across timescales featuring an acute divide across timescales at about the quarterly scale. At longer scales, evidence from the long-term correlation structure can be interpreted as stable perfect integration among Euro stock markets. On the other hand, at intramonth and intraweek scales, the short-term correlation structure has been clearly evolving along time, experiencing a sharp increase during financial crises which may be interpreted as evidence of financial ‘contagion’.},

The Spectral Coherence of the ship-radiated noise was extract, and served as input for a modified MobileNetV2 Convolutional Neural Network classifier. The method was benchmarked in two different dataset and was able to discriminate different classes. In parallel, another three classifiers based on Support Vector Machine were developed. Comparison with previous articles that used the same database was made, as well as, an evaluation of noise immunity was conducted. It was observed that the proposed method presented higher accuracy, even for low signal-to-noise ratios.},

	abstract = {Spectrum sensing of orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) system has always been a challenge in cognitive radios (CR), especially for users which utilize the full-duplex(FD) mode. In this paper, we propose an advanced FD spectrum sensing scheme which can be successfully performed even when encountering severely self-interference from the user terminal. On the basis of "classification converted sensing" framework, the cyclostationary periodogram generated by OFDM pilots is deduced in the form of images. These images are then plugged into the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for classifications due to CNN's strength in image recognition. More importantly, to achieve spectrum sensing against the residual self-interference, as well as the noise pollution and channel fading, we use the adversarial training where a CR-specific, modified training database is proposed. In addition, we propose a design plan of the signal structure for the CR terminal transmitting, which can fit in the proposed spectrum sensing scheme while benefiting its own transmission. Simulation results proved our method possesses an excellent sensing capability for the full-duplex system while achieving higher detection accuracy over the conventional method.},

(2006) [8] have quoted over 1500 different papers recently published that are dedicated to cyclostationarity. An important application of cyclostationary signals is the analysis of mechanical signals generated by a vibrating mechanism. In this area of research the paper by Antoni (2009) [2] shows the importance of cyclostationary models to perform basic operations on signals in the time and frequency domain. The result in this paper presented a new perspective on cyclostationary signal analysis and on frequency identification for such signals. One of the fundamental problems in diagnosis of rotating mechanism is in identification of significant modulating frequencies that contribute to the cyclostationary nature of the signals. So far, the statistical methods for frequency identification in cyclostationary signals were based either on the assumption of gaussianity of the signal and/or on the assumption of some linear structure of the signal. The recent research by Lenart et al. (2008) [13] has shown that there are modern tools available for analyzing cyclostationary signals and they are based on the idea of resampling of observed signals. The aim of this paper is to show applicability of a resampling technique called subsampling in frequency identification for cyclostationary signals. The theoretical results are accompanied with applications to frequency analysis of cyclostationary signal generated by a wheel bearings, one without any damage and the another two with two different types of faults. The result showed that the normal operating conditions and abnormal operating conditions for the bearings can be identified via resampling-based frequency analysis and subsequent frequency identification based on a statistical test.},

	abstract = {This paper is dedicated to modelling rotating machine signals as cyclostationary processes, with strong emphasis on the peculiarities and pitfalls that this issue implies. The objective is to demonstrate that machine signals require specific processing that are much more subtle than for communication signals—from which the paradigm of cyclostationarity was originally issued from and developed for. First, different types of cyclostationarity embracing a multitude of rotating machine signals are distinguished. In particular, the importance of considering pure rather than impure cyclostationarity is stressed out. Next, the relationships between angle and time cyclostationarity are investigated and some useful results are derived. It is shown that vibration signals exhibit cyclostationarity if and only if the random speed fluctuation of the machine is periodic, stationary or cyclostationary. Finally, a comprehensive methodology is proposed for processing actual cyclostationary signals: three typical examples dealing with vibration signals of an IC engine, a gearbox and a rolling element bearing are presented, each of them being characterised by a different type of cyclostationarity. The methodology proposed in this paper is general enough and may serve as a guideline for modelling and analysing other types of rotating machine signals, such as pressure signals, electric signals, etc.},

However, these analyses cannot be guaranteed to be robust if the bearing signals are overwhelmed by large noise. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) was developed from the popular empirical mode decomposition (EMD). However, if there is large noise, it may be difficult to recover impulses from large noise. In this paper, we develop a hybrid signal processing method that combines spectral kurtosis (SK) with EEMD. First, the raw vibration signal is filtered using an optimal band-pass filter based on SK. EEMD method is then applied to decompose the filtered signal. Various bearing signals are used to validate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the hybrid signal processing method can successfully recover the impulses generated by bearing faults from the raw signal, even when overwhelmed by large noise.},

	abstract = {Untimely machinery breakdown will incur significant losses, especially to the manufacturing company as it affects the production rates. During operation, machines generate vibrations and there are unwanted vibrations that will disrupt the machine system, which results in faults such as imbalance, wear, and misalignment. Thus, vibration analysis has become an effective method to monitor the health and performance of the machine. The vibration signatures of the machines contain important information regarding the machine condition such as the source of failure and its severity. Operators are also provided with an early warning for scheduled maintenance. Numerous approaches for analyzing the vibration data of machinery have been proposed over the years, and each approach has its characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. This manuscript presents a systematic review of up-to-date vibration analysis for machine monitoring and diagnosis. It involves data acquisition (instrument applied such as analyzer and sensors), feature extraction, and fault recognition techniques using artificial intelligence (AI). Several research questions (RQs) are aimed to be answered in this manuscript. A combination of time domain statistical features and deep learning approaches is expected to be widely applied in the future, where fault features can be automatically extracted from the raw vibration signals. The presence of various sensors and communication devices in the emerging smart machines will present a new and huge challenge in vibration monitoring and diagnosing.},

	abstract = {Recently, the issue of machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis as a part of maintenance system became global due to the potential advantages to be gained from reduced maintenance costs, improved productivity and increased machine availability. This paper presents a survey of machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis using support vector machine (SVM). It attempts to summarize and review the recent research and developments of SVM in machine condition monitoring and diagnosis. Numerous methods have been developed based on intelligent systems such as artificial neural network, fuzzy expert system, condition-based reasoning, random forest, etc. However, the use of SVM for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis is still rare. SVM has excellent performance in generalization so it can produce high accuracy in classification for machine condition monitoring and diagnosis. Until 2006, the use of SVM in machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis is tending to develop towards expertise orientation and problem-oriented domain. Finally, the ability to continually change and obtain a novel idea for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis using SVM will be future works.},

	abstract = {Fault diagnosis is efficient to improve the safety, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of industrial machinery. Deep learning has been extensively investigated in fault diagnosis, exhibiting state-of-the-art performance. However, since deep learning is inherently uninterpretable, the low trustworthiness of the diagnostic results given by these black-boxes has always been a limiting factor in industrial applications. Specially, the monitoring data under unforeseen domains will be easily misdiagnosed without any symptoms. To address this issue, this paper explores the fault diagnosis in a probabilistic Bayesian deep learning framework by exploiting an uncertainty-aware model to understand the unknown fault information and identify the inputs from unseen domains, ultimately achieving trustworthy diagnosis. Moreover, the diagnostic uncertainty is decomposed in two aspects: (1) epistemic uncertainty, reflecting the discrepancy of test input relative to the training data, and (2) aleatoric uncertainty, referring to the noise originating from the input, offering a deep understanding of the unknowns in the diagnostic model. The proposed framework not only can accurately identify the faults belonging to a known distribution, but also provides insights into uncertainty and avoid the erroneous decision-making. Last, but not least, comprehensive diagnostic experiments considering unseen scenarios are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed framework, providing competitive results.},

	abstract = {In many real applications of planetary gearbox fault diagnosis, the number of fault samples is much less than normal samples while fault samples are hard to collected in different working conditions, so many traditional diagnosis methods will get low accuracy. To solve this problem, a method based on conditional variational auto-encoder generative adversarial network (CVAE-GAN) is proposed for imbalanced fault diagnosis. Firstly, new method uses encoder network of conditional variational auto-encoder to obtain the distribution of fault samples, and then a large number of similar fault samples can be generated through decoder network. Secondly, the parameters of generator, discriminator and classifier may be continuously optimized using adversarial learning mechanism. Finally, the trained CVAE-GAN is applied for intelligent fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox. The experimental results show that CVAE-GAN can generate fault samples in different working conditions, which improve the fault diagnosis performance of planetary gearbox. The sample generating ability of CVAE-GAN is significantly higher than other methods in two cases of imbalanced dataset.},

Using limited fault data to generate massive data with similar distributions is an important premise in applying deep learning methods to solve these problems. In this study, a new data generation approach is designed using a modified Wasserstein auto-encoder (MWAE) to generate data that are highly similar to the known data. The sliced Wasserstein distance is introduced to measure the distribution difference. A squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanism is developed for the encoder to extract more representative features from limited data. The sliced Wasserstein distance with a gradient penalty is designed as the regularization term to minimize the difference between the posterior distribution QZ obtained by the encoder and the predefined Gaussian prior distribution PZ. A dataset of simulated high-speed aeronautical bearings is used to illustrate the data generation ability of the proposed method; a comparison with results obtained using other methods confirms its excellent data generation ability.},

However, in many cases, this identical-distribution assumption does not hold. The assumption might be violated when a task from one new domain comes, while there are only labeled data from a similar old domain. Labeling the new data can be costly and it would also be a waste to throw away all the old data. In this paper, we present a novel transfer learning framework called TrAdaBoost, which extends boosting-based learning algorithms (Freund \& Schapire, 1997). TrAdaBoost allows users to utilize a small amount of newly labeled data to leverage the old data to construct a high-quality classification model for the new data. We show that this method can allow us to learn an accurate model using only a tiny amount of new data and a large amount of old data, even when the new data are not sufficient to train a model alone. We show that TrAdaBoost allows knowledge to be effectively transferred from the old data to the new. The effectiveness of our algorithm is analyzed theoretically and empirically to show that our iterative algorithm can converge well to an accurate model.},

The DBN employs a hierarchical structure with multiple stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines and works through a layer by layer successive learning process. The proposed multi-sensor health diagnosis methodology using the DBN based state classification can be structured in three consecutive stages: first, defining health states and preprocessing the sensory data for DBN training and testing; second, developing DBN based classification models for the diagnosis of predefined health states; third, validating DBN classification models with testing sensory dataset. The performance of health diagnosis using DBN based health state classification is compared with support vector machine technique and demonstrated with aircraft wing structure health diagnostics and aircraft engine health diagnosis using 2008 PHM challenge data.},

	abstract = {Prognostics aims at determining whether a failure of an engineered system (e.g., a nuclear power plant) is impending and estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) before the failure occurs. The traditional data-driven prognostic approach is to construct multiple candidate algorithms using a training data set, evaluate their respective performance using a testing data set, and select the one with the best performance while discarding all the others. This approach has three shortcomings: (i) the selected standalone algorithm may not be robust; (ii) it wastes the resources for constructing the algorithms that are discarded; (iii) it requires the testing data in addition to the training data. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper proposes an ensemble data-driven prognostic approach which combines multiple member algorithms with a weighted-sum formulation. Three weighting schemes, namely the accuracy-based weighting, diversity-based weighting and optimization-based weighting, are proposed to determine the weights of member algorithms. The k-fold cross validation (CV) is employed to estimate the prediction error required by the weighting schemes. The results obtained from three case studies suggest that the ensemble approach with any weighting scheme gives more accurate RUL predictions compared to any sole algorithm when member algorithms producing diverse RUL predictions have comparable prediction accuracy and that the optimization-based weighting scheme gives the best overall performance among the three weighting schemes.},

	abstract = {Vibration-based rolling element bearing diagnostics is a very well-developed field, yet researchers continue to develop new diagnostic algorithms quite frequently. Over the last decade, data from the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center has become a standard reference used to test these algorithms, yet without any recognised benchmark it is difficult to properly assess the performance of any proposed diagnostic methods. There is, then, a clear need to examine the data thoroughly and to categorise it appropriately, and this paper intends to fulfil that objective. To do so, three established diagnostic techniques are applied to the entire CWRU data set, and the diagnostic outcomes are provided and discussed in detail. Recommendations are given as to how the data might best be used, and also on how any future benchmark data should be generated. Though intended primarily as a benchmark to aid in testing new diagnostic algorithms, it is also hoped that much of the discussion will have broader applicability to other bearing diagnostics cases.},

The common method for using the CWRU dataset for demonstrating domain shift is described and a potential flaw is identified. It is argued that the accepted procedure of con­ structing training and testing datasets with different operating conditions does not constitute a useful domain shift problem since the same physical bearings exist in both training and testing sets. To remedy this while using the CWRU dataset, an alternative benchmarking framework is proposed that constructs training and testing datasets with independent sets of bearings. The original and the proposed benchmarking frameworks are compared by training a set of commonly cited diagnosis CNNs within each framework. The results indicate that the original framework allows CNNs to learn features related to specific bearings and may not be able to generalize for different bearings. It is also found that using existing state-of-the-art deep CNNs from other fields in machine learning research may currently present a more efficient option than developing custom CNN architectures for diagnosis when large machine fault datasets are unavailable.},

However, different datasets and hyper-parameters are recommended to be used, and few open source codes are publicly available, resulting in unfair comparisons and ineffective improvement. To address these issues, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of four models, including multi-layer perception (MLP), auto-encoder (AE), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN), with seven datasets to provide a benchmark study. We first gather nine publicly available datasets and give a comprehensive benchmark study of DL-based models with two data split strategies, five input formats, three normalization methods, and four augmentation methods. Second, we integrate the whole evaluation codes into a code library and release it to the public for better comparisons. Third, we use specific-designed cases to point out the existing issues, including class imbalance, generalization ability, interpretability, few-shot learning, and model selection. Finally, we release a unified code framework for comparing and testing models fairly and quickly, emphasize the importance of open source codes, provide the baseline accuracy (a lower bound), and discuss existing issues in this field.

	abstract = {This paper presents a benchmark data set for condition monitoring of rolling bearings in combination with an extensive description of the corresponding bearing damage, the data set generation by experiments and results of data-driven classifications used as a diagnostic method. The diagnostic method uses the motor current signal of an electromechanical drive system for bearing diagnostic. The advantage of this approach in general is that no additional sensors are required, as current measurements can be performed in existing frequency inverters. This will help to reduce the cost of future condition monitoring systems. A particular novelty of the present approach is the monitoring of damage in external bearings which are installed in the drive system but outside the electric motor. Nevertheless, the motor current signal is used as input for the detection of the damage. Moreover, a wide distribution of bearing damage is considered for the benchmark data set. The results of the classifications show that the motor current signal can be used to identify and classify bearing damage within the drive system. However, the classification accuracy is still low compared to classifications based on vibration signals. Further, dependency on properties of those bearing damage that were used for the generation of training data are observed, because training with data of artificially generated and real bearing damages lead to different accuracies. Altogether a verified and systematically generated data set is presented and published online for further research.},

The vibration signals measured from a rolling bearing can reflect the conditions of the bearing, so the vibration signal is often used in the field of bearing fault diagnosis. A number of diagnostic techniques have been studied based on the vibration signals. Deep learning theory is usually used in image recognition or speech processing, and it has attracted more and more attentions in fault diagnosis. In this paper, a method based on deep learning and support vector regression is proposed. The convolutional neural network which is seldom used for one dimension signal is used for promoting feature extraction capability. Besides, the support vector regression (SVR) is an upgrading of the support vector machine which has great generalization ability and can be improved for classification by regression theory. The proposed method is achieved through a hybrid model which combines these two techniques. The presented method is used to classify the bearing fault patterns and obtains better results than that of the convolutional neural network and support vector regression machine separately.},

	abstract = {This tutorial is intended to guide the reader in the diagnostic analysis of acceleration signals from rolling element bearings, in particular in the presence of strong masking signals from other machine components such as gears. Rather than being a review of all the current literature on bearing diagnostics, its purpose is to explain the background for a very powerful procedure which is successful in the majority of cases. The latter contention is illustrated by the application to a number of very different case histories, from very low speed to very high speed machines. The specific characteristics of rolling element bearing signals are explained in great detail, in particular the fact that they are not periodic, but stochastic, a fact which allows them to be separated from deterministic signals such as from gears. They can be modelled as cyclostationary for some purposes, but are in fact not strictly cyclostationary (at least for localised defects) so the term pseudo-cyclostationary has been coined. An appendix on cyclostationarity is included. A number of techniques are described for the separation, of which the discrete/random separation (DRS) method is usually most efficient. This sometimes requires the effects of small speed fluctuations to be removed in advance, which can be achieved by order tracking, and so this topic is also amplified in an appendix. Signals from localised faults in bearings are impulsive, at least at the source, so techniques are described to identify the frequency bands in which this impulsivity is most marked, using spectral kurtosis. For very high speed bearings, the impulse responses elicited by the sharp impacts in the bearings may have a comparable length to their separation, and the minimum entropy deconvolution technique may be found useful to remove the smearing effects of the (unknown) transmission path. The final diagnosis is based on “envelope analysis” of the optimally filtered signal, but despite the fact that this technique has been used for 40 years in analogue form, the advantages of more recent digital implementations are explained.},

Recently, the use of diagnostics and prognostics methodologies assisted by artificial intelligence tools such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines etc. have increased for assessing the health of the rolling element bearings. The effectiveness of these approaches largely depends upon the quality of features extracted from the bearing signals. Keeping this in mind, the authors have presented the various signal processing methods applied to the fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings with the objective of giving an opportunity to the examiners to decide and select the best possible signal analysis method as well as the excellent defect representative features for future application in the prognostic approaches. The review article first quotes some of the condition monitoring tools used for rolling element bearings and then the importance of signal processing methods in diagnosis and prognosis of rolling element bearings. Next, it discusses the various signal processing methods and their diagnostic capabilities by dividing them into three stages: first stage corresponding to the articles published before the year 2001, second stage refers to the articles published during the period 2001–2010 and lastly the third stage pertains to the articles issued during the year 2011 to till date. To focus more on the recent developments in the signal processing methods, the third stage has been partitioned further into several sections depending upon the methodology of signal processing. Their relative advantages and disadvantages have been discussed with regard to the fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings.},

Conventional methods for anomalous sound detection face practical challenges because the distribution of features changes between the training and operational phases (called domain shift) due to various real-world factors. To check the robustness against domain shifts, we need a dataset that actually includes domain shifts, but such a dataset does not exist so far. The new dataset we created consists of the normal and abnormal operating sounds of five different types of industrial machines under two different operational/environmental conditions (source domain and target domain) independent of normal/abnormal, with domain shifts occurring between the two domains. Experimental results showed significant performance differences between the source and target domains, indicating that the dataset contains the domain shifts. These findings demonstrate that the dataset will be helpful for checking the robustness against domain shifts.

	abstract = {Traditional machine learning makes a basic assumption: the training and test data should be under the same distribution. However, in many cases, this identical-distribution assumption does not hold. The assumption might be violated when a task from one new domain comes, while there are only labeled data from a similar old domain. Labeling the new data can be costly and it would also be a waste to throw away all the old data. In this paper, we present a novel transfer learning framework called TrAdaBoost, which extends boosting-based learning algorithms (Freund \& Schapire, 1997). TrAdaBoost allows users to utilize a small amount of newly labeled data to leverage the old data to construct a high-quality classification model for the new data. We show that this method can allow us to learn an accurate model using only a tiny amount of new data and a large amount of old data, even when the new data are not sufficient to train a model alone. We show that TrAdaBoost allows knowledge to be effectively transferred from the old data to the new. The effectiveness of our algorithm is analyzed theoretically and empirically to show that our iterative algorithm can converge well to an accurate model.},

	abstract = {The advances of intelligent fault diagnosis in recent years show that deep learning has strong capability of automatic feature extraction and accurate identification for fault signals. Nevertheless, data scarcity and varying working conditions can degrade the performance of the model. More recently, a tool has been proposed to address the above challenges simultaneously. Meta-learning, also known as learning to learn, uses a small sample to quickly adapt to a new task. It has great application potential in few-shot and cross-domain fault diagnosis, and thus has become a promising tool. However, there is a lack of a survey to conclude existing work and look into the future. This paper comprehensively investigates deep meta-learning in fault diagnosis from three views: (i) what to use, (ii) how to use, and (iii) how to develop, i.e. algorithms, applications, and prospects. Algorithms are illustrated by optimization-, metric-, and model-based methods, the applications are concluded in few-shot cross-domain fault diagnosis, and open challenges, as well as prospects, are given to motivate the future work. Additionally, we demonstrate the performance of three approaches on two few-shot cross-domain tasks. Typical meta-learning methods are implemented and available at https://github.com/fyancy/MetaFD.},

	abstract = {Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction has been a hotspot topic, which is useful to avoid unexpected breakdowns and improve reliability. Different bearing failure behaviors caused by multiple failure modes may lead to inconsistent feature distribution, which affects the prediction model performance. To accurately predict the RUL of bearing under different failure behaviors, a transferable convolutional neural network (TCNN) is proposed to learn domain invariant features. In the proposed method, a convolutional neural network is employed to extract the degradation features. Then multiple-kernel maximum mean discrepancies are integrated into optimization objective to reduce distribution discrepancy. The trained TCNN can be used to predict RUL by feeding data. Its effectiveness is verified by a run-to-failure bearing dataset. The comparison results reveal that the proposed method avoids the influence of kernel selection, improves the performance of domain adaptation effectively, and achieves a better RUL prediction performance.},

	abstract = {Vibration-based rolling element bearing diagnostics is a very well-developed field, yet researchers continue to develop new diagnostic algorithms quite frequently. Over the last decade, data from the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center has become a standard reference used to test these algorithms, yet without any recognised benchmark it is difficult to properly assess the performance of any proposed diagnostic methods. There is, then, a clear need to examine the data thoroughly and to categorise it appropriately, and this paper intends to fulfil that objective. To do so, three established diagnostic techniques are applied to the entire CWRU data set, and the diagnostic outcomes are provided and discussed in detail. Recommendations are given as to how the data might best be used, and also on how any future benchmark data should be generated. Though intended primarily as a benchmark to aid in testing new diagnostic algorithms, it is also hoped that much of the discussion will have broader applicability to other bearing diagnostics cases.},

Data analysis can be improved by applying machine learning algorithms and fusion of data from heterogenous sensors. This paper presents an approach for a step-wise integration of classifications gained from vibration and acoustic emission sensors in order to combine the information from signals acquired in the low and high frequency ranges. A test rig comprising a drive train and bearings with small artificial damages is used for acquisition of experimental data. The results indicate that an improvement of damage classification can be obtained using the proposed algorithm of combining classifiers for vibrations and acoustic emissions.},

We show that better phone recognition on the TIMIT dataset can be achieved by replacing Gaussian mixture models by deep neural networks that contain many layers of features and a very large number of parameters. These networks are ﬁrst pre-trained as a multilayer generative model of a window of spectral feature vectors without making use of any discriminative information. Once the generative pre-training has designed the features, we perform discriminative ﬁne-tuning using backpropagation to adjust the features slightly to make them better at predicting a probability distribution over the states of monophone hidden Markov models.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a fault diagnosis technique based on acoustic emission (AE) analysis with the Hilbert–Huang Transform (HHT) and data mining tool. HHT analyzes the AE signal using intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which are extracted using the process of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Instead of time domain approach with Hilbert transform, FFT of IMFs from HHT process are utilized to represent the time frequency domain approach for efficient signal response from rolling element bearing. Further, extracted statistical and acoustic features are used to select proper data mining based fault classifier with or without filter. K-nearest neighbor algorithm is observed to be more efficient classifier with default setting parameters in WEKA. APF-KNN approach, which is based on asymmetric proximity function with optimize feature selection shows better classification accuracy is used. Experimental evaluation for time frequency approach is presented for five bearing conditions such as healthy bearing, bearing with outer race, inner race, ball and combined defect. The experimental results show that the proposed method can increase reliability for the faults diagnosis of ball bearing.},
