# DPMHM

**DPMHM** (prononced "Deep HM") stands for **Diagnosis and Prognosis for Machine Health Monitoring**. It is a library written in Python and Tensorflow for benchmark test of deep-learning based algorithms in the context of machine health monitoring (MHM), featuring

- A collection of open-access database of vibration signals, standardized and formatted using [`tensorflow-datasets`](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/overview)
- Pipelines for automatic preprocessing & transformation of data
- Baseline algorithms: Supervised/Unsupervised/Self-Supervised representation learning, Transfer learning/Few-shot learning for fault diagnosis, Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction etc.
