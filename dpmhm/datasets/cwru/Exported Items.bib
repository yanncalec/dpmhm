	abstract = {Vibration-based rolling element bearing diagnostics is a very well-developed field, yet researchers continue to develop new diagnostic algorithms quite frequently. Over the last decade, data from the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Data Center has become a standard reference used to test these algorithms, yet without any recognised benchmark it is difficult to properly assess the performance of any proposed diagnostic methods. There is, then, a clear need to examine the data thoroughly and to categorise it appropriately, and this paper intends to fulfil that objective. To do so, three established diagnostic techniques are applied to the entire CWRU data set, and the diagnostic outcomes are provided and discussed in detail. Recommendations are given as to how the data might best be used, and also on how any future benchmark data should be generated. Though intended primarily as a benchmark to aid in testing new diagnostic algorithms, it is also hoped that much of the discussion will have broader applicability to other bearing diagnostics cases.},

	abstract = {Bearing is probably one of the most critical components of rotating machinery. They are employed to guide and support the shafts in rotating machinery. Therefore, any fault in the bearings can lead to losses on the level of production and equipments as well as potentially unsafe. For these reasons, the bearing fault diagnosis has received considerable attention from the research and engineering communities in recent years. The purpose of this study is to review the vibration analysis techniques and to explore their capabilities, advantages, and disadvantage in monitoring rolling element bearings.},

	abstract = {A smart factory is a highly digitized and connected production facility that relies on smart manufacturing. Additionally, artificial intelligence is the core technology of smart factories. The use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms has produced fruitful results in many fields like image processing, speech recognition, fault detection, object detection, or medical sciences. With the increment in the use of smart machinery, the faults in the machinery equipment are expected to increase. Machinery fault detection and diagnosis through various deep learning algorithms has increased day by day. Many types of research have been done and published using both open-source and closed-source datasets, implementing the deep learning algorithms. Out of many publicly available datasets, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset has been widely used to detect and diagnose machinery bearing fault and is accepted as a standard reference for validating the models. This paper summarizes the recent works which use the CWRU bearing dataset in machinery fault detection and diagnosis employing deep learning algorithms. We have reviewed the published works and presented the working algorithm, result, and other necessary details in this paper. This paper, we believe, can be of good help for future researchers to start their work on machinery fault detection and diagnosis using the CWRU dataset.},

	abstract = {Bearings are the most common mechanical components in machines. Once a bearing fails (or components in it), other adjacent components or the machine itself are effected up to failure. Therefore, bearing health condition is of great interest in practice. Several benchmark datasets are developed to evaluate development in bearings health state (diagnosis) and remaining useful lifetime (prognosis). Among these datasets, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset is one of the most cited ones used to validate the performance of different diagnostic approaches. Over recent years, a significant amount of research approaches are developed using CWRU data. Most approaches are focused on specific performance parameters like detection rate or accuracy etc. The main problems in connection with CWRU dataset use are: no overview about latest results is available. Furthermore several results published are not complete, for example published accuracies rate without false alarm rates.In this contribution an overview about the development change over the last years, the approaches applied, and specifically the results obtained will be given. Additionally, the new approaches emerging in recent years like deep learning (DL) also in combination with fusion methods and related performance will be given in comparison with conventional machine learning (ML) methods. Special care will be given to the completeness of published results also in combination with shown robustness. As outcome of this contribution the newest and best results are noted, furthermore a recommendation how to complete research work using benchmark dataset will be given. Although most approaches using CWRU dataset as benchmark get high accuracy, for further bearing fault diagnosis research, more and more suitable measures as well as other datasets are needed for increased performance evaluation.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the use of the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing dataset for benchmarking bearing fault diagnosis convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a domain shift problem. The common method for using the CWRU dataset for demonstrating domain shift is described and a potential flaw is identified. It is argued that the accepted procedure of con­ structing training and testing datasets with different operating conditions does not constitute a useful domain shift problem since the same physical bearings exist in both training and testing sets. To remedy this while using the CWRU dataset, an alternative benchmarking framework is proposed that constructs training and testing datasets with independent sets of bearings. The original and the proposed benchmarking frameworks are compared by training a set of commonly cited diagnosis CNNs within each framework. The results indicate that the original framework allows CNNs to learn features related to specific bearings and may not be able to generalize for different bearings. It is also found that using existing state-of-the-art deep CNNs from other fields in machine learning research may currently present a more efficient option than developing custom CNN architectures for diagnosis when large machine fault datasets are unavailable.},
