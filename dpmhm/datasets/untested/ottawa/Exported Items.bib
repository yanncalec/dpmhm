	abstract = {The data contain vibration signals collected from bearings of different health conditions under time-varying rotational speed conditions. There are 60 datasets in total. For each dataset, there are two experimental settings: bearing health condition and varying speed condition. The health conditions of the bearing include (i) healthy, (ii) faulty with an inner race defect, (iii) faulty with an outer race defect, (iv) faulty with a ball defect, and (v) faulty with combined defects on the inner race, the outer race and a ball. The operating rotational speed conditions are (i) increasing speed, (ii) decreasing speed, (iii) increasing then decreasing speed, and (iv) decreasing then increasing speed. Therefore, there are 20 different cases for the setting. To ensure the authenticity of the data, 3 trials are collected for each experimental setting which results in 60 datasets in total. Each dataset contains two channels: 'Channel\_1' is vibration data measured by the accelerometer and 'Channel\_2' is the rotational speed data measured by the encoder. All these data are sampled at 200,000Hz and the sampling duration is 10 seconds. The CPR (Cycles Per Revolution) of the encoder is 1024.},

	abstract = {Under normal operating conditions, bearings often run under time-varying rotational speed conditions. Under such circumstances, the bearing vibrational signal is non-stationary, which renders ineffective the techniques used for bearing fault diagnosis under constant running conditions. One of the conventional methods of bearing fault diagnosis under time-varying speed conditions is resampling the non-stationary signal to a stationary signal via order tracking with the measured variable speed. With the resampled signal, the methods available for constant condition cases are thus applicable. However, the accuracy of the order tracking is often inadequate and the time-varying speed is sometimes not measurable. Thus, resampling-free methods are of interest for bearing fault diagnosis under time-varying rotational speed for use without tachometers. With the development of time-frequency analysis, the time-varying fault character manifests as curves in the time-frequency domain. By extracting the Instantaneous Fault Characteristic Frequency (IFCF) from the Time-Frequency Representation (TFR) and converting the IFCF, its harmonics, and the Instantaneous Shaft Rotational Frequency (ISRF) into straight lines, the bearing fault can be detected and diagnosed without resampling. However, so far, the extraction of the IFCF for bearing fault diagnosis is mostly based on the assumption that at each moment the IFCF has the highest amplitude in the TFR, which is not always true. Hence, a more reliable T-F curve extraction approach should be investigated. Moreover, if the T-F curves including the IFCF, its harmonic, and the ISRF can be all extracted from the TFR directly, no extra processing is needed for fault diagnosis. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm for multiple T-F curve extraction from the TFR based on a fast path optimization which is more reliable for T-F curve extraction. Then, a new procedure for bearing fault diagnosis under unknown time-varying speed conditions is developed based on the proposed algorithm and a new fault diagnosis strategy. The average curve-to-curve ratios are utilized to describe the relationship of the extracted curves and fault diagnosis can then be achieved by comparing the ratios to the fault characteristic coefficients. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by simulated and experimental signals.},

	abstract = {Bearings often operate under time-varying rotational speed conditions. Processing the signal in the time-frequency domain and extracting the Instantaneous Fault Characteristic Frequency (IFCF) and the Instantaneous Shaft Rotational Frequency (ISRF) are important approaches for bearing fault diagnosis under time-varying speed conditions without signal resampling and without using a tachometer. However, there are two problems: (1) the collected bearing signal is often contaminated by random noise and interferences transmitted from other components, which affects the accuracy of the extracted IFCF, and (2) the ISRF cannot always be found in the Time-Frequency Representation (TFR) of the extracted bearing fault transients, which impacts the accuracy of fault identification. Therefore, a new tachometer-free and resampling-free method is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis under time-varying speed conditions which consists of three main steps: (1) bearing fault signature extraction via Oscillatory Behavior-based Signal Decomposition (OBSD) to suppress the influence of random noise and interferences, (2) IFCF and ISRF estimation via applying a IFCF\&ISRF search algorithm to the TFR of the decomposed signal, and (3) automatic bearing fault identification based on the average curve-to-curve ratios of the searched IFCF and ISRF. The IFCF\&ISRF search algorithm is proposed based on the analysis of the frequency characteristics of bearing vibration signals. The algorithm can estimate the ISFR even if it is not present in the extracted bearing fault signature. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using both simulated signals and experimental data.},
